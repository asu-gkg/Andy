# About Me

This is Andy. Now I'm a Postgraduate Student in HKUST-GZ. My supervisor is [Dirk Kutscher](https://dirk-kutscher.info/).

My research interests are operating systems, networked systems, 
distributed systems.

I'm trying to be a [hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html).
I highly recommend [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
to people in computer science field.

Personally, I'm a political junkie.
