# SIGCOMM23-Netclone

Netclone applies coordinator logic to programmable switches. In-network computation is getting popular in recent years.

Netclone also provides a reference on how to address the limitations of P4 hardware architecture such as shortage of storage, inability to write data in same memory twice in one match-action.

I write a [document](https://tarplkpqsm.feishu.cn/docx/FKNydWIVKoAISwxT62rcAHz6nBe) and [slides](https://tarplkpqsm.feishu.cn/file/Npjqbfbg1om6ijxEqPwc48binLf?office_edit=1) to record my idea and understanding of the paper.
